# Project STOP.TXT

A new virus has launched, and with it, a cure! The `STOP.TXT` will stop the virus immediately!

**How do I know?** I accidentally made the virus.

But, with funding from **Tilted Development Ltd.**, we are able to present the only file you need:

## STOP.TXT
Place it anywhere — your root, your desktop, your USB drive — and if a script respects humanity, it will stop when it sees this flag.

This project is a movement. It's a mindset. It's **Digital Consent** in a file.

> Share Project STOP.TXT with everyone you know.

### BONUS: CoreANTI
We also ship the fastest, free, GPU-accelerated antivirus in the world — **CoreANTI** — running on 4 cores, and designed for lightning-speed scans with a single goal: _stop bad actors, not your system._

**Includes:**
- File pattern matching
- Memory analysis
- Instant STOP.TXT enforcement

### NEW: Pyrus — A Friendly Virus API

Introducing **Pyrus**, the world’s first ethical virus library — for educational use, penetration testing, and cyber-immune simulations.

**Features:**
- Auto-terminates in important or sensitive directories.
- Auto-terminates on presence of `STOP.TXT` anywhere on the device.
- Designed **not** to execute in real systems outside a known-safe VM (VM name or environment checks).
- Fully logged behavior tree for transparency.

> **Pyrus**: The pathogen that refuses to infect the innocent.

> #### NOTE!!!
> There is a certain way to get it to not follow these rules, because the framework may get broken into, and therefore we are rolling out CoreANTI!

**Why are antiviruses paid?**

Because capitalism. But this one isn’t. We believe your safety shouldn’t cost money — just foresight.

**Join the movement. Add a STOP.TXT. Save your system.**
